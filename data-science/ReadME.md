# Data Science 


## Loss Functions / Cost Functions 
- The measure of how well a model is performing with respect to its input. 
- During Machine learning training, the goal is to minimize the loss function. 
- This is similar to measuring the margin of error between the predicted value and the actual value.
### Types:
1. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - The average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value.
    - This is commonly used in regression tasks.
