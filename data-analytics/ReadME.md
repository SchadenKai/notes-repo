# Data Analytics

## Parametric 
- this describes a clear relationship between all the features (dependent and independent variable) in a data. 
- it can be visualzied as having a subtle pattern as the value of X (independent variable) increases. 

## Nonparametric
- this describes the data that has no clear relationship between its features. 
- it can be visualized as having a cloud of distribution or more scattered distribution
- meaning, the independent variable's value does not affect the value of the dependent variable (thus having not relationship)
